Abdicator
A powerful gun that is guild crafted only, and for a reason!
This CQC powerhouse is master of running upto mobs and people alike to point blank unload them.
Adding this to natural spawns would ruin its many balancing facters on being hard to craft well also powerful!
It also has more matterals then it takes to craft as a way to have a sunk cost.

	It fires a super heated blast of concentrated laser pellets in a similar fashion to the Reductor, but loses stopping power rapidly over a distance, so it is most effective at point blank range. \
	Unlike the Reductor or Myrmidon, the secondary firing mode uses a chemical blend to fire flare rounds, offering some utility. When overclocked, the battery is turned into a rocket propelled grenade. \
	Use with caution! This design was originally blue-printed by the Soteria Institute before cooperation with the Artificer Guild allowed regulated usage by experienced Artificers."
