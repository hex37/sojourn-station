//There are important things regarding this file:
//Rubbers are non sharp, embed capable objects, with non existing armor penetration. Their agony damage is generally lower then actual one.
//The total amount of calibers we have is not likely to change, as you see we have A LOT. -CDB
//HV exist as a form of armor penetrating round. They should have lower wounding lower damage higher AP.
//Step delays - default value is 1. Lower value makes bullet go faster, higher value makes bullet go slower.
//Hollowpoint do extra damage against targets that lack armor sufficient. They should have higher wound mult and lower damage to account for the damage_mult.
//Wounding multiplier is generally based on bullet width, it affects some damage procs.
//rifle rounds should generally have lower wounding mult vs handgun rounds(the latter of which are more limited in how many rounds are available, with exception of 9mm/.35)

//Low-caliber pistols and SMGs
