/*
Beams, they are rather harder to get armor against and dont have bullet drop off.
Thus they are objectively always going to be outclassed by bullets in their ideal use.
Beams also can pass through glass and are hitscan, thus making them great against most problems.
In pvp they also have more lasting damages, such as infections, pain form burns, and nerve damage.
