	<p>The official report will be filed elsewhere with the proper codes and syntax, I am writing this strictly because it is fresh in my memory and I do not wish to leave out any details. \
	Normally these scenarios would be day to day, as subject 390 is in our high threat scenario ward. The unusual quality of his rather violent reaction this time was an exhibited \
	propensity to self harm. According to 390's file, which is under seal by order of the benefactor, he has a long history of violent and unprovoked behavior. Not once in our care, nor \
	in any record prior, has he ever turned his psychosis onto himself. What is more disturbing to me is his reason. Subject 390 was under standard observation after injection of \
	serum #1408. He displayed the usual reactions and behaviors within his padded cell before he suddenly began to gnaw his wrist open. An unfortunate mishap in the airlocks opening \
	mechanism resulted in a delayed response, by the time the airlock could be forced open subject 390 had managed to remove most of the flesh down to the bone. Standard disabling protocol \
	was employed, but proved troublesome given subject 390's exceptional level of bleeding made him difficult for my team to bring down and handcuff.</p><br>\
	<br><p>Later testing revealed that the blood was indeed belonging to subject 390. However, the quantity suggest that the single grevious wound on his wrist expelled nearly half is life blood. \
	The problem with that, obviously, is losing half your blood should result in death or at the very least unconciousness, but subject 390 was still able enough to require three men to bring him \
	down. More so that he was able to very lively scream the entire time, even after being injected with soporific and tasered. He kept going on about his 'king' and how much he needed to prepare \
	for his arrival. All nonsense, but I swear that while he was screaming, the blood pools around him were... Spreading? Deepening? I cannot quite describe it, it was as if the spreading gore was \
	growing on its own. Subject 390 was quickly put under by a chloral hydrate hypo-injector. I later asked one of the guards if they saw anything unusual, but they assured me everything was well \
	within normal operating standards.</p>"

	In any case, the work proceeds just fine, we make strides and progress onward and upward, though what exactly is within our serums is yet to be known even to me. The benefactor was very \
	clear not only on the value of our work but to retain incredible safety protocols. I was actually quite taken by it, as in all the years I've known the man I haven't ever seen him so \

	<p>Why I got into the habit of logging my thoughts onto paper, I'll never know. Still, qoute of the day is 'One mind is all the spark needed to set things ablaze' a qoute that is either a joke or \
	prophetic. The rate of incidents, both violent and anomalous have increased nearly ten fold by the arrival and subsequent injection of subject #389, a wholly unremarkable subject if a bit \
	abnormal in the aspect of his high degree of intelligence, cognitive understanding, and will power when ran through the usual tests. Subject #389 was and is, rather pleasent and upon speaking \
	with the man myself would have concluded, even with my numerous studies and knowledge, that he was a kind and considerate if a bit intense person. Sadly for him, his file revealed his numerous \
	and productive criminal history, up to and including murder, which explains why he ended up here for testing. Under the benefactors directive and instruction however, we were able to pinpoint \
	precisely when the surge in problems began which started when subject #389 was injected with the serum. Within the week we had four escapes from genetics, six suicide attempts on prisoners \
	and nearly fourteen anomalous occurances. One of the most unusual ones occured when scientist noted one of the patients in his cell had a knife, but when the prisoner was subdued and searched \
	nothing was found. Yet not ten minutes after the search was concluded two different researchers saw the patient with a knife. Naturally, the subject was subdued and searched again only for \
	no knife to be found. This happened four more times before the situation was logged as an anomaly. Upon questioning, the patient said it was merely his mind attempting to escape and then \
	went into a bizarre explanation that his next words and 'gospel' as he put it would be very important but by then I was hardly listening. We have enough people who go mad after getting the \
	serum and honestly its starting to bore me.</p><br>\
	<br><p>Another note before I finish this entry for the day. I have often speculated why the benefactor wants us to perform this experiment with such absolute precision and with such careful methods. \
	Often, I find myself pondering more and more why he put such extensive methods in place to ensure not only our success but the safety of the people here. Normally we are left to live and die \
	on our own merits. Our work is either very important or, as the benefactor told me personally, he truly cares for the people here. I have noticed that, among our number, are some of the brightest \

	attempt to escape the facility but from my guess there isn't really an escape. The halls of the labs are now winding, changing, darkened and filled with the remains of our collegues. \
	More than once we've encountered the same lab, the same remains, the same room but heavily changed, as if everything within was an imperfect copy. Everything always folds back into itself in \
	some round about way or simply leads to dead ends. I write this final entry because I know were going to die down here. We made this hell and now we shall remain in it. Yet, nothing could have \
	prepared me for... It is better unwritten. If anyone finds this, know that you are in grave danger. We have laid traps where we can, fortified our positions, but it shall not help us.</p><br>\
