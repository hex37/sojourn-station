	description = "The ideal role for new characters. You are not a member of the colony (yet) but a foreigner who has been let in. As such, you do not require records.<br>\
You're held to very different standards. Use this freedom to determine your place in the world; Have you come from space, hoping to make a home in this place?<br>\
Are you a straggler from the woods, just looking for a few nights reprieve from the horrors of this planet?<br>\
Perhaps your intent for the colony is less charitable, intent to take advantage of your host's misplaced trust?<br>\
<br>\
Regardless of what your reasons may be, remember that you are a guest in this place. If you cause issues the Marshals or Shield may simply show you the gate, or worse."
