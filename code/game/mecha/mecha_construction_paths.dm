	How this works - After we install the in this case armor we then are on "step 2"
	Well were on a step think of it as a limbo state of "step.5" were they dont know if they are going
	backwords or not.
	Using this information you can see why rather then when undoing step 2, we do not get are armor back
	were basiclly at 1.5 when adding it on so we need 3.5 to take it off.
	Confusing and hard to read? Yes. Works? Also yes.

	Are we A: backkey-ing?
	Are we B: welding in example_armor?
